## Portfolio Projects
In this section you can find short summary of the listed projects for quick comprehension.

### **Analysis - Olist Store Brazil**
**Code:** [Olist Store Analysis.sql](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/olist_store_analysis.sql)

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data using SQL to gain business insights. The distribution of payment methods, total revenue, and the number of orders per seller are examined to understand transaction patterns. Customer and product rankings based on transaction volume are identified, followed by calculations of average delivery time and shipping costs per city. Customer retention and churn rates are evaluated, while product profit margins and order cancellation comparisons are further analyzed. Additionally, the relationship between distance and shipping costs is explored. These analyses aim to support decision-making in e-commerce business strategies and operations.

### **Dashboard - Superstore Analaysis**
**Tableau Public:** [Superstore Dashboard.twbx](https://public.tableau.com/shared/M8TXRS2XT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Image output:** [Superstore Dashboard.png](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Super%20Store%20Dashboard.png)

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, and product trends using an interactive dashboard. The analysis includes total sales, profit, and order count to evaluate business performance. Sales distribution is visualized across states, while customer segmentation categorizes buyers into Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. The dashboard identifies top-selling products and sub-categories, providing insights into revenue drivers. Additionally, shipping mode analysis helps understand order distribution by delivery type, and a monthly sales trend chart highlights seasonal patterns. This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to optimize sales strategies and operational efficiency.

### **Data Processing - House Price**
**Code:** [House Price Data wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/house_price_data_wrangling.ipynb)

This project focuses on exploring and processing house price data using Python. The first step is to understand the dataset structure by examining data types and detecting missing values. Missing values are handled based on their nature, distinguishing between truly missing values and those intentionally marked as "NA" to indicate the absence of a specific feature. Next, numerical and categorical data are processed with appropriate imputation techniques. This is followed by detecting and handling outliers using the IQR method to ensure a more representative data distribution. Visual analyses, such as boxplots and probability distributions, are used to identify patterns within the dataset. With this approach, the dataset is prepared for further analysis or predictive modeling to determine factors influencing house prices.

### **RShiny - Child Nutrition Status**
**Code:** [RShiny Child Nutrition Status.R](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/rshiny_child_nutrition.R)

**Website:** [Website Link for Child Nutrition Status](https://mubadiulfitriyani.shinyapps.io/statusgizibalitajatim/)

This project focuses to develop a web interface to determine the nutritional status of toddlers in East Java Province, Indonesia. Users can input the child's name, weight, height, and date of birth. Additionally, users can choose the nutritional status standard based on the WHO Standard or the Local Standard Design (East Java Province). The output includes the nutritional status category along with a growth chart. Furthermore, the website provides articles on child health.

### **Data Processing - Air BnB**
**Code:** [Air BnB Data Processing.ipynb](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/airbnb_data_processing.ipynb)

This project focuses on processing and analyzing Airbnb listing data using Python, specifically leveraging Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The data processing phase involves selecting relevant columns such as host details, price, and property attributes, converting date columns into the proper datetime format, and cleaning percentage-based values like host response rates. Missing values are handled using mode and median imputation, while categorical inconsistencies in property types are standardized to ensure uniformity. Additionally, duplicate records are removed, and outliers in price data are addressed using the interquartile range (IQR) method to improve data reliability.
