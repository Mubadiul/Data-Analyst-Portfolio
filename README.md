## Portfolio Projects
In this section you can find short summary of the listed projects for quick comprehension.

### **Analysis - Olist Store Brazil**
**Code:** [Olist Store Brazil Analysis.sql](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Olist%20Store%20Brazil%20Analysis.sql)

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data using SQL to gain business insights. The distribution of payment methods, total revenue, and the number of orders per seller are examined to understand transaction patterns. Customer and product rankings based on transaction volume are identified, followed by calculations of average delivery time and shipping costs per city. Customer retention and churn rates are evaluated, while product profit margins and order cancellation comparisons are further analyzed. Additionally, the relationship between distance and shipping costs is explored. These analyses aim to support decision-making in e-commerce business strategies and operations.

### **Dashboard - Super Store Analaysis**
**Code:** [Super Store Analysis.twbx](https://public.tableau.com/shared/M8TXRS2XT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Image output:** [Super Store Analysis.png](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Super%20Store%20Dashboard.png)

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, and product trends using an interactive dashboard. The analysis includes total sales, profit, and order count to evaluate business performance. Sales distribution is visualized across states, while customer segmentation categorizes buyers into Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. The dashboard identifies top-selling products and sub-categories, providing insights into revenue drivers. Additionally, shipping mode analysis helps understand order distribution by delivery type, and a monthly sales trend chart highlights seasonal patterns. This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to optimize sales strategies and operational efficiency.

### **Data Processing - House Price**
**Code:** [House Price Analysis.pynb](https://github.com/Mubadiul/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Processing%20-%20House%20Price.ipynb)

This project focuses on exploring and processing house price data using Python. The first step is to understand the dataset structure by examining data types and detecting missing values. Missing values are handled based on their nature, distinguishing between truly missing values and those intentionally marked as "NA" to indicate the absence of a specific feature. Next, numerical and categorical data are processed with appropriate imputation techniques. This is followed by detecting and handling outliers using the IQR method to ensure a more representative data distribution. Visual analyses, such as boxplots and probability distributions, are used to identify patterns within the dataset. With this approach, the dataset is prepared for further analysis or predictive modeling to determine factors influencing house prices.
